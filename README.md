## Remix this project!

Of course, you can remix this project by just editing `script.js.` For example:
- *Change classes*: How many, names of classes, and so on.
- *Change what happens*: Change what happens when each class is recognized. Make it show something,
say something, or even connect it to something you're building â€“ a game, etc.
